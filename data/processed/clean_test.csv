 how to unlock frozen in this update have no daily challange so i cant compleat my mission and how to unlock frozen and new outfits for players it is very hard to find mystery box in this update so guys please fix these problems,0
 too bad but improving the earlier version was so nice i have been using that one since the days of nokia symbian the new one is double the size and takes more space its not even as fast as the earlier one what a shame seems improved after update,0
 very good aap i can delete my importent picks without aney kind of risk just beacouse of drop box,1
  very useful for watching tv reading saptahikkantipur,1
 game ruined because of ads i felt like redownloading after havent playing it in awhile but i was immediately frustrated a 20 second awful mobile game ad popped up after the second level and after looking at the store i realized that you have to pay to remove ads yep uninstalling,0
 app requires frequent login password why the hell this app everytime requires password to openthis is not expected from proffesional app like thiswho the hell remembers password for each and every app or site,0
  i love dropboxbut i wish that the interface didnt look so cheap its the only thing thats letting down a potentially stunning app make it look as great as its functionality and ill happily give it five stars no qualms,1
 cant connect right now when trying to open links in the facebook browser i receive a cant connect right now error message other items on my news feed continue to load,0
 brilliant the best application ive found so far for team collaborations,1
 mms failure still have issues with group messaging and images even tried fixes proposed on google product forum its shocking this is a primary mobile app on the platform google cant get it right im on a nexus 6p also so no good hardware excuses,0
  very useful ,1
 wonderful apps i have downloaded this apps in my cellphone its very good apps for those who loves nepali language great apps,1
 continually fails to upload files great when it works but i have had enormous trouble with getting it to auto upload from my phone usually i have to uninstall then reinstall to get this function  which is the one that i use dropbox for the most  to work very annoying,0
 useful and well designed however glitchy the app is really well designed however ive begun to notice that if you end a call while it was on mute or if the call loses reception because of wifi issues on either persons end the app does not record how long the conversation lasted in fact it doesnt show that a call even took place,0
 old is gold i used to play this game a lot when iwas nearly in 4 std but even after 4 years when im in 8 the this game still continues to be my fav  i really never get tired of playing this as u know now that this is my fav,1
 what the hell stole all my boosters all my boosters and power ups are gone return it now had more than 60 of each what a cheap manner to manage the game return all power ups nowww,0
 viber rating  lacking code on the android phone the in call widget is over the top command for all settings alterations on the screen it is not able to be moved and i cant find the setting to turn it off might wanna fix it also it seems not to want to ring on the android phone when you make a call,0
 unable to work with google  yahoo id sso notice that it still cant work with google  yahoo sso which is a big feature missing  it is a good initiative but still some work to be done before the star  still thanks for the effort  ,0
 outstanding this app is not only fabulous on android platform but also popular this is the first app which can be useful for all people  ,1
 popup and search using image i seriously hate that opera mini does not support popups i need popups enabled from where do i choose to enable it i am forced to use uc browser due to this  and please provide an option in the long press menu to search using any image please guys  we are waiting  reply atleast ,0
 wont load everytime i try to use facebook well lately it says trouble loading in every aspect its been doing this for 2 days ive tried restarting my phone closing the app it doesnt work,0
 great way to stay organized i jot notes for work family shopping lists music  things to do and stories or news feed i want to come back to great place to store everything,1
 good but not great app is awesome saves me a ton of memory but i think it should add a few more features to make use even better 1 you should had a select all button when moving upload pics to dropbox albums its a real pain checking individually 250 pictures to move to album 2 once pictures are in album the thumnail should sell you how many pictures are currently in that album if you could do those 2 things it would be âââââ,0
 great simple and great apps for news lover i always used to read news from ekantipur website but now this has made my task times easier thanks to the developer,1
  every time i press the send button a black background appears this doesnt happen before the update it sucks coz it forces whatever im doing to stop like watching videos,0
 enjoying im unable to delete items from the trash on either samsung phone or tablet  are you able to let me know how or make this available in an update sometime   thanks,0
 its getting hang once i will be chatting with someone seriously and it gets hang suddenly and i wont be able to type nor open my wechat and after few mints it saying wechat is not responding properly and have to stop it pls take a look at it ,0
 it rocks this thing is  great i keep documents photos everything accessible on all my devices current very slick,1
 hamro keyboard this is good app no doubt about it however adding some features will definitely make it the best app following are few things observed 1 the option to have the caps lock key enabled should be made available 2 few letters were not available along with words 3 also there are very less options when we go to the numbers option and one of the signs which is missing is the underscore 4 easy toggle option between the phone keyboard and app keyboard should be made post this it will be 5 star,1
 the best game about they dont call this the no1 app for nothing its the original and best clean game about one needs to work out how best to strike the piggy structures by flinging the birds in a sling funny though i thought they had wings it is a wonderful novel idea for a game and will no doubt will continue to appeal to a wide audience for some time to come its as big as what the old lemmings game was in the 1990s its so addictive and fun to play whilst having a good feel about it for me beats angry birds 2 game very easily and will no doubt remain so for the near future the only flaw in it is loads of adds and becomes so slow when connected to the internet but thankfully the in game adds can be binned for a small fee but it also plays fine offline,1
 always my go to cloud storsge been using dropbox for years to store music photos and just about anything else never fails me,1
 viber about the voice messages and chatting viber is the best app in the market about the calling services  even messenger performs better the app isnt optimised for wifi usage about the newest version until 23122015 there is a new option introduced which allows you to see which of your friends have seen your message in a group chat well it is not working and this makes me a little bit mad  finally the function was introduced in viber and still not working properly,1
 the new features suck for those of us who dont have a working back button can you guys make the videos able to be slid to the left to exit the video as i have to force close facebook to exit,0
 good its very good to use    but i found some fualts   while writing lengthy status the words which we enter at starting will not be visible so to edit those words we should slide through the text we have written   so make status editing line step by step instead a single line,1
 ever so useful evernote it is so easy to scribble something down when you have your smart phone tablet laptop or whatever  you can be spontaneous yet accurate because you write when you are at the place and at the time  when you return to your main computer your writing is there waiting for you  almost magical  such a time saver and a memory keeper,1
 superfast just as i remember it  opera mini was the 1 browser back in the days of symbian glad to see itstill up there superfast smooth minimal data used as opposed to chrome which is starting to stutter  lag even on simple pages with a few commercials,1
 candy crush i have been  having trouble playing on candy crush so in the end i uninstalled it  i then reinstalled and signed back in in doing this im back to my level but lost all my boosters,0
 good app for free this is a great collabo app especially since its free  i asked for 2 things and slack delivered 1 proper gif viewing 2 ability to change profile pic from app  functionality complete,1
 great app the latest update to slack has enabled an in app experience for gifs and while it isnt the smoothest implementation it is definitely a step in the right direction really enjoy using the app and their responsiveness to user comments makes this a great experience,1
  i dont get notifications from people anymore also the number of notifications i got doesnt go away after i have checked it it kind of just stays there,0
 its useful a great app and pretty much an essential part of my organization a minor complaint is that the desktop program doesnt look as appealing as the mobile app and that the mobile version is lacking some useful functions eg the ability to delete tags or to strikethrough text,0
 fastest browser its fast its reliable the only problem i have with it it dont like to download videos or games so both videos  games it goes to the site just no downloads come up  also the lil emojis that have action to them it dont show their lil action i would give a 5 star rating but until then a 3 star is all i hate that to cause this really is a fast browser maybe the fastest so please fix those bugs  ,1
 brilliant but not complete please add more emojis and if possible themes too u need to compete with others eventually,1
 great app but one problem ruins it i love the firefox for android its fast and efficient and all the addons are great yet the menu key problem ruins the app firefox will automatically turn on or off the menu key based on if it detects a hardware menu button the only  problem is it gets it wrong sometimes and theres no way to force it,1
  it was a great game  until the last update  and cost of upgrade for th10 has always been beyond the reach of the average players  and lets not start about the time to wait for the upgrades to finish   seems like supercell only cares aboutwants high level trophy pushers  and they dont want people who dontcant buy gems to even to touch this game or maybe even like it,0
 doesnt login crap doesnt work only app tat work with todoly is cue  ,0
 richard perez like itmoved it to sd card and couldnt get it backnow trying to re download for like three hoursout of high speed dataand cant connect to wifidont know why or if download going to be complete should have waited before i rated it four stars,0

  i enjoy twitter but im extremely annoyed that i cant swipe left or right through an accounts twitter pictures as easily as before now just tapping the picture takes me to the whole tweet i have to be super cautious to not accidently tap the picture while im swiping its incredibly annoying please go back to how it was before if i were to want see the whole tweet just touch the caption,0
 very nice app best feature is all friends get in touch with it runs well during roaming and with low signal i hope to see some improvement as in group chatting if we have tag feature or topic hashtag feature within the group so that we can refer to a particular topic in discussion  just like in twitter etc but within the group not public would be great,1
 last seen and dp not showing the last seen and display pictures of my contacts and mine only shows when its privacy is set to everyone it doesnt show when its set to contacts this happened after last update kindly fix it,0
 viber i think so shes going to you guys you know figure out free for the rings sometimes i forget to ring in all forget to the shop the message of this one now ill let you know no i hope you figure out later so thats my paper right,0
 this new update crashed with my samsung note4 my phone suddenly all black out   shut down after receiving a wechat message notification after update my chat backgrounds were all gone blank  i cant find my stickers as well i have to uninstall the app  but dont know if my chat history will be here or not,0
  cool app except the notifications freeze so i have no idea of the upload status even worse dunno if it even worked or safe to delete those files becomes more of a broken app to me another issue i wanted to create a new account for a friends new phone exclaimed that 2 year 50 gig is available and it shows it is until after you waste time following all of your steps to get 250 mbs or something worthless keep it honest,0
  great hamro patro,1

 google messenger and hangouts should become one google messenger and hangouts should become one app that works like imessages except android if it detects they are using hangoutsgoogle messenger it will send a message in the form of hangouts which will show up in the conjoined app but if it doesnt detect them using hangoutsgoogle messenger then it will simply send a sms message instead,0
 its getting there i used to be a chromeopera aficionado but lately they eat too much ram that my phone starts to hang firefox memory consumption is far less and its more stable however i dislike how websites get blurred when scrolling then slowly clear up like a jpeg being downloaded on a slow connection i use 4g and bandwidth aint a problem i know you can fix it but ill give you 4 stars for now thanks for the awesome browser,0
